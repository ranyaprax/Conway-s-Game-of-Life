# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Simply download the java file and run it on an IDE of your choice. 
Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game, meaning that no other input is needed other than the initial state. It then evolves based on the following 4 rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

In this version, the playing field is a 40x40 grid of squares, where white squares represent live cells and black cells represent dead cells. There is an option to randomise the initial grid or press/press and drag any squares to change their color and intialise your own grid. Lastly, there is an option to save the current initial state or current generation (after you have started) and later load it back in.
